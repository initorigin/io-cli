# IO CLI

A terminal agent that shows you what it is allowed to do, what it is spending,
and what it refused — while it works.

`io` is an interface. The agent loop, the providers, the tools, the sandbox, the
permission boundary and the session store are all
[io-harness](https://github.com/initorigin/io-harness), and none of them are
reimplemented here. A test asserts that: `tests/dependencies.rs` fails the build
if this crate ever grows an HTTP client, a TLS stack, a database or a sandbox.

![A session in flight: the IO CLI mark and the finished transcript sitting in the
terminal's own scrollback, a prompt, and one status line naming the model, a
moving indicator beside the word `working`, and the elapsed clock — which
advances on its own while the first token is still on its way.](docs/screenshot.png)

## It never takes your terminal

`io` does not enter the alternate screen and does not capture the mouse, in any
mode, behind any flag. Every finished message, tool call and system line is
committed into the terminal's own scrollback; a few lines at the bottom hold the
composer and the status line, and only those repaint.

So when the session ends the whole conversation is still there. Your terminal's
search finds it, tmux copy-mode scrolls it, and a mouse drag selects it — none of
which is implemented here. It works because it was never taken away.

That is a property, not an intention. `tests/structure.rs` captures every byte
`io` writes to the terminal over a scripted session and fails if the
alternate-screen or mouse-capture sequences appear, so no later release can
reintroduce fullscreen without turning a named test red.

## Install

macOS and Linux:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/initorigin/io-cli/main/install.sh | sh
```

Windows, in PowerShell:

```powershell
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/initorigin/io-cli/main/install.ps1 | iex
```

Both scripts pick the right build for your machine, **verify it against the
published `SHA256SUMS` before unpacking it**, and install into a directory you
own — `~/.local/bin`, or `%LOCALAPPDATA%\io\bin` on Windows. Neither needs
administrator rights and neither edits your shell profile: if the directory is
not on your `PATH`, the script prints the line to add.

Re-running the script is how you update. There is no auto-update and no version
check: a terminal tool that contacts a server you did not ask it to contact is
one of this product's stated non-goals.

Set `IO_VERSION` to install a specific version, and `IO_INSTALL_DIR` to install
somewhere else.

**What the checksum is and is not.** It defends against a truncated download and
a tampered asset. It does not defend against a compromised repository — piping a
script from the internet into a shell is a trust-the-publisher model however the
script is written, and this is the honest description of it. Read
[`install.sh`](install.sh) first if you would rather not take that on trust.

There is no crates.io publish and `cargo install io-cli` is not a path. To build
from source, clone this repository and run `cargo build --release`; the binary is
`target/release/io`.

## First run

Run `io` in a repository. With no configuration it walks you through a provider,
a key it verifies against the live endpoint before continuing, a model from that
provider's catalogue, a theme with the sample re-rendering as you move, and a
default permission posture. It shows exactly what it will write and where, and
writes nothing until you say so. The file is io-harness's own, at mode `0600`.

Run it again at any time with `io setup`.

Your key never appears on screen, in the scrollback, or in a log line. If the
provider's environment variable is already set, the wizard offers to use it and
writes no key to disk at all.

## Keys

<!-- keys:start -->

| Key | Does |
| --- | --- |
| `Enter` | send the prompt |
| `Shift+Enter` | new line (or end the line with \ and press Enter) |
| `Up / Down` | walk prompt history |
| `Ctrl+C` | interrupt the turn; twice at an empty prompt, exit |
| `Ctrl+D` | exit, on an empty prompt |
| `Shift+Tab` | cycle the permission posture, from the next turn |
| `Ctrl+L` | clear the viewport, never the scrollback |
| `Esc Esc` | at an empty prompt, undo the last turn — its files and all |
| `Ctrl+T` | put the whole conversation back into the scrollback |
| `y / a / n` | answer an approval: allow once, allow this session, deny |
| `Esc` | close a picker without choosing |

<!-- keys:end -->

**`Shift+Enter` works where the terminal reports it.** `io` negotiates the Kitty
keyboard protocol on terminals that advertise it, asking for one flag —
`DISAMBIGUATE_ESCAPE_CODES` — because without it a terminal sends the same byte
for `Enter` and for `Shift+Enter` and the newline binding is unreachable. What is
pushed is popped again on every path out of the process, a panic included. The
trailing-backslash fallback still works everywhere, and on a terminal that does
not advertise the protocol nothing is written at all.

### Moving a key

The keys the session itself owns can be rebound in `[app.io-cli.keys]`, by action
name:

```toml
[app.io-cli.keys]
clear = "ctrl+k"
rewind = "ctrl+r ctrl+r"
```

| Action | Default |
| --- | --- |
| `exit` | `Ctrl+D` |
| `posture` | `Shift+Tab` |
| `clear` | `Ctrl+L` |
| `transcript` | `Ctrl+T` |
| `rewind` | `Esc Esc` |

A binding is a chord, or two chords separated by a space. Modifiers are `ctrl`,
`alt` and `shift`, joined to the key with `+`, in any order and any case; a key is
a single character, a named key — `esc`, `enter`, `tab`, `backtab`, `space`, the
four arrows, `home`, `end`, `pageup`, `pagedown`, `backspace`, `delete`, `insert`
— or `f1` through `f12`. Because `+` is the join, `+` itself cannot be bound; that
is a real limit of the syntax and stating it beats a rule that quietly works for
`plus` and not for the character anyone would type. This spelling is public
contract from 0.6.0 on: it is the one VS Code, Zed and helix already write.

The rest of the table is not rebindable, because those keys belong to whatever
owns the keyboard while it is up — the composer, an approval, a picker — and an
approval's `y`, `a` and `n` are the *words* of the answer rather than shortcuts
for it.

**`Ctrl+C` is fixed, and it is the only one that is.** It interrupts a running
turn and leaves `io`, so a configuration file able to take it away is one able to
lock you inside a running agent. Both spellings of that mistake are refused out
loud with the reason: naming `interrupt`, and putting any other action onto
`ctrl+c`.

Nothing about a bad line is fatal and nothing is silent. A value that cannot be
read leaves its action on the default and names the key it kept; a name that is no
action of ours says which names there are; and every notice is committed into the
scrollback as the session starts, rather than left to be discovered by pressing
something. `/help` renders the table as the session *actually behaves* rather than
the defaults that shipped, and marks `Ctrl+C` as fixed.

## Commands

<!-- commands:start -->

| Command | Does |
| --- | --- |
| `/help` | this table |
| `/quit` | leave |
| `/setup` | run the first-run wizard again |
| `/theme` | change the theme for this session |
| `/model` | change the model the next turn is sent to |
| `/resume` | reopen an earlier session where it stopped |
| `/fork` | continue from an earlier turn of this conversation |
| `/expand` | commit the last step's full detail into the scrollback |
| `/copy` | put the last answer on the system clipboard |
| `/copy diff` | put the whole run's patch on the system clipboard |

<!-- commands:end -->

**Everything that shows you more of something writes it into the terminal's own
scrollback.** `Ctrl+T` and `/expand` do not open a pane: the viewport is a few
rows and this product has no alternate screen, so the place to read something
long is the buffer where the terminal's search, selection and tmux copy-mode
already work. `/expand` reads the step's full output back out of the run's
durable trace, which is where it went in the first place — the screen is not the
archive.

`/copy` uses OSC 52, so it reaches the clipboard of the machine you are *sitting
at* rather than the one you are ssh'd into. Nothing acknowledges an OSC 52 write:
the line it prints says what was sent and how large it was, never that it
succeeded. Inside tmux it needs `set -g set-clipboard on`, and some terminals
refuse a large payload without saying so.

`/theme` and `/model` change this session only and say so. Making a choice
permanent is `io setup`.

## Reading it without seeing it

`io --plain` runs the session without animation: nothing turns, nothing moves,
the ASCII glyph set is forced, and each state the session enters — `working`,
`ready` — is committed into the terminal's own scrollback as a line of text. In
the default interface that one state is carried by a word that only ever repaints
and an indicator that only ever moves, which makes it the single thing a reader
who cannot see the viewport cannot follow; everything else a run does already
writes a line. For a screen reader, a braille display, a serial console and a
captured log.

The flag is global, so `io --plain`, `io --plain exec "…"` and `io exec --plain
"…"` are all accepted. `[app.io-cli] plain = true` is the same switch for every
session. The flag wins over the file, and there is deliberately no `--no-plain`:
accessibility is something switched on on purpose, and a mode that can be lost to
a stray flag is not one to rely on. It reaches an interactive session and stops
there — `io exec` constructs no theme, draws nothing and animates nothing already.

Four properties this product keeps, whether or not that flag is set:

- **Colour is never the only thing carrying a meaning.** Every refusal, error and
  warning also carries a word, a diff's additions and removals are marked as well
  as coloured, and an approval says what is being asked for in words before it
  says it in colour. `NO_COLOR` is honoured on presence, whatever its value, and
  now survives the first-run wizard and `/theme`: choosing a theme with the
  variable set records the preference and leaves the session uncoloured, and says
  so.
- **Every mark has an ASCII form.** The separator, the tool bullet, the selection
  marker, the ellipsis, the elision, the dash, the transcript rule, the quotes,
  the credential mask and the working indicator each exist in two sets, and each
  ASCII form carries its counterpart's *meaning* rather than merely standing in
  the same column. `[app.io-cli] glyphs` names a set — `unicode` or `ascii` —
  and an absent key asks the locale: `LC_ALL`, then `LC_CTYPE`, then `LANG`, the
  first one present deciding. The set is an axis of its own, in both directions:
  `NO_COLOR` keeps the Unicode marks, and the ASCII set arrives at a fully
  coloured theme. The IO CLI wordmark is the one exception, and it is suppressed
  rather than transliterated — a wordmark redrawn in `#` is a different and worse
  image wearing its name.
- **The cursor sits where input is expected**, on every frame that accepts any:
  the composer, including at a width too narrow to draw it; the approval overlay;
  the selected row of a picker; and every step of the wizard. It is the focus
  indicator a screen reader follows, and a frame that leaves it hidden reports no
  focus at all.
- **A frame whose content did not change is not drawn.** An idle session writes
  no bytes to the terminal, so nothing announces itself twice for having merely
  repainted.

## Headless

`io exec "<goal>"` runs one goal to completion with no terminal, prints the
agent's reply on stdout, and exits with a status that says how the run ended.
It is the same session layer, the same policy, the same store and the same
events as the interactive product — a second consumer of io-harness rather than
a second program.

```sh
io exec "add a test for the parser and run it"
io exec --json "fix the failing test" | jq -r 'select(.event=="step") | .decision'
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=… io exec --provider anthropic -m claude-sonnet-4 "tidy the imports"
```

| Flag | Does |
| --- | --- |
| `--json` | write the run's events to stdout as newline-delimited JSON instead of the reply |
| `--sandbox <mode>` | `read-only`, `workspace-write` or `full-access` — where a command this run executes may write |
| `--policy <posture>` | `workspace` or `read-only` — what the agent may attempt at all |
| `--provider <name>` | `openrouter`, `anthropic` or `openai` — take the credential and model from the environment instead of a file |

`--sandbox` and `--policy` are different axes and share the word `read-only`.
One is where the sandbox lets a command write; the other is what the policy
permits the agent to try.

**`--policy ask-writes` is refused.** Nothing in a headless run can answer an
approval, so honouring it would turn *ask before writes* into *deny writes*
without saying so. Every approval in a headless run is declined, and the
refusal is fed back to the agent as an observation it can adapt to — which is
what it already does with a policy refusal.

### Exit status

| Code | Means |
| --- | --- |
| `0` | the run ended of its own accord |
| `1` | it never got that far — no provider, a bad credential, an unreadable configuration, a usage error |
| `2` | a boundary said no: denied, refused, or a rejected plan |
| `3` | a ceiling was reached: steps, time, tokens, or the tree's shared budget |
| `4` | the run stopped needing a human: it asked a question, or proposed a plan |
| `5` | it ended without finishing: stalled, escalated, or cancelled |

A ceiling is `3` and not `0` because io-harness returns one as a *successful
call* whose outcome says a limit was hit; a status read off the result alone
would call a truncated run a finished one.

**Give the goal an end condition.** How a run ends is the agent's behaviour, not
this interface's: a goal with no clear stopping point can keep the agent working
after the useful part is done, until io-harness's stall policy ends the run — and
that is `5`, even though the work happened. The same goal on the same model
reached `Finished` on one run and `Stalled` on another while `io exec` was being
tested. `io` reports what the harness decided and never relabels it, so
"…, then stop" in the goal, or a `max_steps` in `[run]`, is worth more than
retrying.

### The JSON

One object per line, and nothing else on stdout, so it pipes straight into a
reader. The objects are `io_harness::RunEvent` serialized by io-harness's own
derive — the same shape its `[[hook]]` writer appends to a file and its store
keeps in `run_events.json`:

```json
{"run_id":41,"step":2,"depth":0,"event":"step","decision":"wrote src/lib.rs","tool_call":"write_file","tokens":812,"changed":true}
```

The variant's fields sit beside the envelope's rather than under a key of their
own. Because io-cli forwards the harness's type rather than modelling one of its
own, every event kind reaches the stream — including the thirty-nine the
interactive renderer has no way to draw. **There is no timestamp**: `RunEvent`
does not carry one, and inventing an envelope to add one would make this a
format io-cli owns rather than one it passes through.

Progress, warnings and the closing summary go to stderr, so redirecting it
leaves the data alone.

## Configuration

io-cli has no configuration parser. io-harness owns discovery and layering, and
io-cli's own settings live in the `[app.io-cli]` section that io-harness
deliberately does not validate. See [`docs/config.example.toml`](docs/config.example.toml).

Four keys live there, and one table:

| Key | Is |
| --- | --- |
| `theme` | `dark` or `light`. Absent detects from the terminal background. |
| `diff` | `unified` — the default, and what an absent key means — or `minimal`, the changed lines and the `@@` header without the context, for reviewing by file rather than by hunk. |
| `glyphs` | `unicode` or `ascii`. Absent asks the locale. |
| `plain` | `true` runs every session in plain mode. The same switch as `--plain`, which wins over it. |
| `[app.io-cli.keys]` | the session's keys, by action name. See [Moving a key](#moving-a-key). |

Because the section is unvalidated by design, an unrecognised *value* reads as the
default rather than stopping a session from starting. A section io-harness cannot
parse **at all** is a different case and is no longer silent: through 0.5.0 that
reverted the theme, the diff style and everything else in the section at once with
nothing said about it, and the session now starts on the defaults carrying
io-harness's own message — which names the key that broke — in its scrollback.

The file is found in this order: `$IO_CONFIG`, else `$IO_CONFIG_HOME/io.toml`,
else `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/io/io.toml` or `~/.config/io/io.toml`, and
`%APPDATA%\io\io.toml` on Windows. A project's own `io.toml` and a gitignored
`io.local.toml` layer on top of it.

One thing worth knowing: a **project** file may narrow the permission boundary
and may never widen it, because a repository you cloned must not be able to grant
itself permission. The wizard therefore writes the user-scope file, which is
where widening is your own decision.

**What this release reads from that file, and what it does not.** io-cli reads
the provider, the permission policy and its own `[app.io-cli]` section. The
policy's own defaults are what `Shift+Tab` cycles; a posture chosen with the key
lasts for the session and is not written back, because a keystroke that rewrites
a permission boundary on disk is the opposite of what that key is for. **An interactive session** does **not** yet apply `[sandbox]` limits, `[run]`
budgets, `[[mcp]]`, `[[lsp]]`, `[[agent]]` or an `AGENTS.md` instruction file to
a turn. The reason is specific rather than an oversight: io-harness's steerable
turn builds its own task contract, and the entry point that takes a caller's
contract does not take a steer inbox — so honouring those sections in a session
would mean giving up `Ctrl+C`. The sandbox itself **is** on: a workspace turn
runs commands inside it, with no resource ceilings.

**`io exec` does apply them**, and that is not a second implementation — it is
the same boundary reached from the other side. A headless run has nobody to
steer it, so it can hand the harness a contract of its own, which is what
`[sandbox]` and `[run]` travel in. So a `max_steps` or a `max_wall_secs` you set
today has an effect in CI and none in your terminal, and that asymmetry is a
property of the harness's entry points rather than a decision made here.

`NO_COLOR` is read from the environment rather than from this file, and so is the
locale behind `glyphs`. See [Reading it without seeing
it](#reading-it-without-seeing-it).

## What this release is not

0.6.0 is the release where the interface can be read without being seen:
`--plain`, an ASCII form for every mark, keys that can be moved, and a cursor
wherever input is expected. The slash palette and type-to-filter pickers are
0.7.0; the fleet tree is 0.8.0; inline images are 0.9.0.

**`io exec` runs one goal and stops, and a run that pauses stays paused.** An
agent that asks a question about what you meant, or proposes a plan, ends the run
at exit `4` with the question persisted in the store. That is io-harness's
behaviour and it is the right one — a machine answering a question about intent
on your behalf sends the agent down a path nobody chose — but there is no `io
resume` in this release to answer it and carry on, so the run is parked rather
than lost. The closing line names its id. Approvals are the one pause that cannot
happen, because they are declined rather than deferred.

There are no `--max-steps`, `--timeout` or `--max-tokens` flags either: `[run]`
in the configuration file expresses all three, and a CI job's limits belong with
the project rather than in every invocation.

**A rewind does not check whether you edited a file yourself since the turn.** It
puts each file back to the state before that turn first wrote it, and it does not
compare that against what is on disk now — so a hand edit made afterwards is
overwritten. `io` cannot detect this, because the snapshot it restores from is not
readable from outside io-harness; what it does instead is tell you, in the prompt,
before the second keystroke. This is what `git checkout -- <path>` does too, and
it is said here rather than left to be discovered. Making it preventable is a
change to io-harness, not to this interface.

**A rewind undoes one turn**, the last one, and **`/resume` lists the twenty most
recent sessions** — saying so when it has cut the list, rather than quietly
showing you a subset. Filtering a picker as you type arrives at 0.7.0, and until
then a list nobody can reach the bottom of is worse than a short one that admits
its edges.

Three more things are absent for reasons worth stating rather than hiding. **Spend
against the tree ceiling is not in the status line**: io-harness emits
`SpendDraw` only from a contained turn, and its contained entry point takes no
steer inbox, so rendering spend today would cost `Ctrl+C`. It arrives at 0.8.0
with the fleet, which is contained anyway. **A diff cannot be expanded beyond
the context the harness stored** — three lines either side, which is what
`diff -u` has always carried; more than that is not in the trace, and reading it
off disk would be reading a version of the file that no longer exists. And
**there is no split view**: this renderer commits into the terminal's own
scrollback at its real width, a two-column comparison doubles the horizontal
budget for every line, and word-level emphasis inside a unified diff already
answers the question split view answers.

One ceiling worth knowing about: a hunk is a fragment of a file, and each of its
lines is highlighted from a clean parse. A block comment or a multi-line string
that was opened *above* the hunk is not known here, so those lines read as code.
