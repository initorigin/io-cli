//! io-cli — a terminal interface over [io-harness].
//!
//! This crate renders run events, edits a prompt, and reads a keyboard. It
//! contains no agent loop, no provider client, no tool implementation, no
//! sandbox, no policy engine and no session store; all of that is the harness,
//! and `tests/dependencies.rs` asserts it rather than trusting it.
//!
//! The library half exists so the integration tests can reach the renderer, the
//! composer and the picker. `io` itself is the binary in `src/main.rs`.
