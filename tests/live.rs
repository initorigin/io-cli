//! The live rehearsal for F1.
//!
//! Every test here is `#[ignore]`d, so `cargo test` never runs one and CI — which
//! holds no secrets — never tries. Run them by hand with a key in the
//! environment:
//!
//! ```text
//! export OPENROUTER_API_KEY=sk-or-...
//! cargo test --test live -- --ignored --nocapture
//! ```
//!
//! **These do not satisfy F1 and are not meant to.** F1 is a person at a real
//! terminal, taking a first run from an empty configuration through the wizard to
//! a verified edit, interrupting a second turn mid-flight, and then searching and
//! selecting the transcript with the terminal's own facilities afterwards. None
//! of that has a tty here, and the recording of it is the release evidence.
//!
//! What these do is prove the halves of F1 that a terminal is not needed for, so
//! that the manual run is not the first time any of it has been exercised: the
//! credential check against a real endpoint, the catalogue read, and a real turn
//! driven through the real bridge and the real event renderer, editing a real
//! file inside the sandbox.
